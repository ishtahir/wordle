## Description

This is a simple implementation of the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. The game is built using HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. Players are given 6 attempts to guess a hidden word. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help the player refine their guesses.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Randomly selects a word from a dictionary API.
- Provides feedback after each guess (correct letters, misplaced letters, and incorrect letters).
- Displays a message when the game ends (win or lose).

## How to Play

1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Enter your guesses in the input field provided.
3. Click the "Submit" button on the on-screen keyboard or press "Enter" to submit your guess.
4. The game will provide feedback on your guess and update the remaining attempts.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
